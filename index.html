The dining room and lounges feel more functional than fancy, though they're full of brightly woven rugs and pretty florals. Outside, a vine-covered courtyard offers a peaceful nook to sit and relax, with several deck chairs and a swinging bench. The lush and expansive gardens stretching down to the lake have tons of picnic spots, scattered with tables and chairs, pillows and cushions, and an outdoor fireplace amongst the trees. Food prepared at Olerai House is mostly farmed on-site, and you're welcome to explore the gardens or even help with picking your day's fare. The pool is not only a lovely spot to cool off, but also for getting up-close-and-personal with the resident zebras, who seem to love grazing here. There are four uniquely styled rooms inside the original house and one separate cabin in the garden which has two bedrooms sharing a bathroom. All rooms are cosy and comfortable, with a combination of earthy tones and bright colors, as well as art and object that represent the home's rich heritage. Wood, woven textiles and pottery are used harmoniously throughout. En-suite bathrooms are light and simple, with showers and bathtubs. The Cabin (in the garden) is equipped with a self-catering kitchen, a dining room, and a lounge with French doors opening onto a private terrace and garden. This place feels like Eden, from hearty cuisine and friendly service to unhurried walks and relaxed wildlife. Choose the outdoor cabin for a slightly wilder experience. The main attraction of <strong>Olerai House</strong> is excellent accessible <strong>game drives</strong> in search of rhinos and the other inhabitants of the <strong>Soysambu Conservancy</strong>: As this is a privately run conservancy, not a national park, there are large areas where you can drive off road and night drives are also possible. Other activities include <strong>walking safaris</strong> accompanied by an armed ranger, and <strong>visits to cultural villages</strong> which can be booked at an additional cost. It is also possible to go <strong>horse riding, </strong>these are usually afternoon activities and can be dependent on availability. Lunch is often served 'family style' outside on the lawn, where diners are presented with a selection of salads, breads and a meat dish such as curried chicken skewers, perhaps accompanied with savoury tart. This is usually followed by a light desert such as homemade mango sorbet. Dinner is then a more formal affair with three courses. There is a daily changing menu with several options for each course including a vegetarian choice. Children can be provided with a safari activity book for them to take on game drives, complete with coloring pens. The guides are very accommodating and will happily show children how to use bows and arrows and look for tracks and signs around the Lodge. Olerai House can also arrange seasonal activities such as Easter egg hunts. There are no cots and highchairs at Olerai House however with advance notice the lodge may be able to make arrangements, The lodge is relatively safe to run around and children will enjoy the swimming pool. Despite the electric fence there is still lots of wildlife in the area and children should be supervised at all times, particularly around the swimming pool. Olerai House accepts all major currencies, including USD dollars, Kenyan shillings, GB pounds and Euros. MasterCard and Visa are accepted without surcharge, all booking must be confirmed and paid for in advance. Homestead lifestyle is all about relaxing, but for the adventure-driven there's plenty to see and do in the surrounds. Walk through the sanctuary with a guide (be aware there are buffalo and hippos around), or hike the ridge behind Olerai for spectacular views. If you really want to climb, get the lodge to arrange a day trip to Mount Longonot, a beautiful, dormant stratovolcano that stands over 9000 feet high. Scenic flights through the Rift Valley, horse-riding at a nearby farm, golf, and tours of local villages and industrial flower farms prominent in this region can all be arranged through the lodge. Go mountain biking in Hell&rsquo;s Gate National Park, take a motorboat to Crescent Island on Lake Naivasha with its 450 species of birds, or visit Lake Oloidien in search of pink flamingos. Most activities are at extra cost. Enjoy the luxury of high-speed internet. We have got you covered, be it for Zoom Calls or presentations.

                              <strong>Olerai House</strong> is one of Kenya&rsquo;s best-kept secrets, a charming and relaxing getaway on the shores of Lake Naivasha, where you can immerse yourself in luxury and comfort in a beautiful farmhouse on a private wildlife sanctuary just two hours by road from Nairobi. Nature was left to take charge of this former cattle farm in 2001, and today, the farmhouse is shrouded in bougainvillea and the scent of wildflowers fills the warm air. Wild animals graze beneath soaring acacias, while down by the lake fish eagles swoop in for a kill or cry their haunting call as hippos harrumph close by. It is one of those secret little gems where people in the know go for a romantic weekend, for a break with the family from the stresses of the city, or to iron out hours of travel fatigue. Come to stay with us, pamper yourself and your loved ones, and feel yourself breathe deeper and slower as you reconnect with a simpler rhythm. We will do everything we can to make you feel at home.                            </p>

                              The main homestead at Olerai House opens a window into what life was once like for the old Rift Valley farmers. Back then, a pepper tree with widespread branches was often planted beside the building to shade the house. On the other side lay a courtyard leading to a smoky wood-stove kitchen. Baskets and bowls for the dogs sat on the stone floor and meat hung in the outdoor meat safe. Small, netted windows fitted into the thick walls to keep heat, dust and bugs out, and a diesel generator puffed away in the evenings to provide electricity. Nearby sat a large metal drum perched over a fire and roughly plumbed into the house to provide hot water.&nbsp;Self-sufficiency was highly prized as it was the norm to live off the land. Since those days, Olerai has been opened up and modernised into a lovely rambling country lodge. Creepers tumble off the roof,&nbsp;scenting the air with flowers, a big &lsquo;piazza&rsquo; courtyard leads to a modern kitchen, there is electric light, freezers and refrigerators, an efficient hot water stove, and a little generator that switches on automatically to cover for the odd power cut. Instead of cows mooing at night, what you will hear are buffalos and hippos grunting just outside your room as they pull up the succulent green grass, owls hooting in the acacia trees, and an hyaena howling in the distance. Each of our six unique en-suite bedrooms look out over the gardens and the expansive views beyond, and each has its own comfortable charm. Oversized beds laid with crisp linen stand beneath cosy mosquito nets. Chunky carved furniture decorates some rooms. Soft couches and armchairs sit in others. All have en-suite bathrooms with hot baths or showers and organic soaps and lotions to enrich your experience.&nbsp;We want you to relax and enjoy your stay                            </p>

                                  The chefs at Olerai House are famous for the variety and scrumptiousness of the meals they produce, all made with organic ingredients grown or pasture-raised on the farm. The emphasis is on using the freshest possible produce to craft simple but exceptionally tasty meals that you&rsquo;ll remember long after your stay.&nbsp;You&rsquo;re welcome to pick your own vegetables from the garden, or ask us for recipes: we&rsquo;re happy to share! Breakfast is a feast. Start with succulent fruit, warm scones, freshly baked brioche and hot pancakes, or our special homemade granola with thick natural yoghurt. Then eggs just how you like them, grilled sausages, crisp bacon and herbed tomatoes. Everything is served with homemade fruit juices and fresh Kenyan coffee and tea.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t forget to try our special honey in the comb, fresh from our organic apiary. The tantalizing aromas of lunch and dinner being prepared fill the house after breakfast and throughout the day. Each meal is a sensory delight. They might include rosemary and garlic focaccia, a fresh soup like our cold avocado or&nbsp;beetroot gazpacho, the chef&rsquo;s special lasagna, succulent farm lamb spare rib casserole, or crispy duck. On the side will be plenty of organic vegetables and salads, and our relishes, jams, pickles and pat&eacute;s. For dessert, you will be spoiled with our homemade ice creams or cakes including sticky toffee pudding, all covered in organic cream from a neighbouring farm. Guests with special dietary requirements will not be left out. Our chefs take pride in designing bespoke menus for those with particular needs. Just let us know in advance so that we can have everything ready for you.&nbsp;We enjoy the challenge and love trying out new dishes                                </p>

                                  <strong>Olerai House</strong> has a formidable team of women and men who have been with us since the initial stages of turning the property from a working farm into a country lodge and sanctuary. Together, they helped to convert the buildings and furnish all the rooms, sewing the curtains and crafting the chair covers, perfecting the bedrooms and painting the bathrooms.&nbsp;Pride in their work infuses each day, and guests are attended to with great care. All our staff have been expertly trained and carry out their work with efficiency and attention to detail that makes Olerai somewhere very special to stay. You will also find that everyone is extremely friendly and ready to help you with whatever you might require. Please just ask! Our chefs&rsquo; skills were honed under the tutelage of Oria Douglas-Hamilton, whose Italo-French heritage is evident in her love and preparation of food in the best tradition of Italian cooking and baking, with the meticulous artistic eye of the French. Melded together with the freshest, sun-ripened African ingredients and a passionate local team, Olerai has its own style of Afro-Italian gourmet cuisine that we like to think is unique. We have an exceptionally dedicated team of staff outdoors too, including charming local guides, grounds men, security staff and pool attendants, who know the secrets of all the animals. Anything that you need, there&rsquo;s guaranteed to be someone nearby who will be happy to help                                </p>

                                  Since the farm was turned over to wildlife in 2001, and nature allowed to take charge, Olerai has become a real haven for a fascinating assortment of mammals, reptiles, bugs and birds. Hundreds of large mammals graze peacefully on the plains surrounding the House, like&nbsp;Thomson&rsquo;s gazelle, Cape buffalo, Maasai giraffe, Burchell&rsquo;s zebra, impala, Colobus monkeys and waterbuck. Around them flit the countless colourful birds that gather around Lake Naivasha and make it world famous for ornithologists. Fish eagles, lilac-breasted rollers, pied kingfishers and several varieties of lovebirds are all among the 450 species of birds seen here.&nbsp;It is truly a bird-watcher&rsquo;s paradise. As a guest at <strong>Olerai House</strong>, you are never far from the animals. Zebra graze just beyond the terrace as you sip your breakfast coffee. Later, a family of warthog might trot across the lawns by the swimming pool. Out on a bush walk, you will see up close herds of giraffe gliding through the yellow fever trees, and hear the snort of a hippo surfacing for air down in the lake. At twilight, leopard stretch and yawn considering what to hunt, and hyena wait for the night air to cool to amplify their whooping calls. Under huge skies in this secret African Eden, surrounded by pristine nature and majestic animals, you will feel your worries recede and a renewed calm take their place

                                  come to Olerai for a variety of reasons. Maybe you are on your way to a Kenya safari in a distant corner of Kenya. You could be taking a short break from the city with your family, or are here as part of a special event. Whatever brought you to Olerai, we&rsquo;re pretty sure you will feel relaxed, rejuvenated, and reconnected by the end of your stay, like so many of our guests, warmed by the sun, rejuvenated by the fresh air and sounds of nature. We like to think that that is because everyone finds something to fill their time exactly as they wish at Olerai House. That could be doing absolutely nothing: grabbing a novel from the shelves dotted around the Lodge, curling up on a plump cushion in the garden, and losing yourself in your book until the next mealtime rolls round. We recommend looking up occasionally, though, to check on the giraffe or zebra that are likely to be grazing or browsing nearby, or the colobus monkeys high up in the treetops. Or you could spend the day sunning by the swimming pool, exchanging recipes in the kitchen, or perhaps lazing on a daybed with a stupendous view to enthrall you. Equally, though, you could be on your feet out exploring from dawn until dusk. An enchanting stroll through the Sanctuary led by our charming local guides opens your eyes to the environment and the wildlife all around. More strenuous hikes could include a long hill climb up the ridge behind Olerai, or an extended walk along game paths that crisscross the property. Further afield, we can arrange a day trip to conquer Mt Longonot, a sunrise horseback ride amongst wildlife, or a picnic in any number of secret little places we are happy to share with you. Ask us to arrange any of these activities for you, but please be aware that some may incur additional costs on top of your otherwise inclusive rate.

                                  <strong>Olerai House</strong> guests are welcome to use the swimming pool beside the Douglas-Hamilton&rsquo;s family home, Sirocco, where you and your family and friends can spend sunny days lazing around while the kids play in the water. Above you, colobus and vervet monkeys bound through the shady fig trees, and we often see zebra walking across the lawns beyond the pool. Head back to the Lodge for lunch, or ask us to arrange a barbecue there by the pool, then snooze the afternoon away. At 14m, the pool is long enough for serious swimmers to put in some strenuous laps, too

                                  Often Africa&rsquo;s wild places are seen only from a vehicle. At Olerai House, in the company of a local guide, you can see the landscape as our ancestors did: on foot and at ground level. You will never forget the experience of walking across grasslands as zebra, giraffe, impala and waterbuck graze nearby. Your guide will take pride in pointing out interesting plants, tracks, birds and geology. Our walks can be designed to accommodate guests of all levels of fitness. For those keen on moving a little faster through the wilderness, we&rsquo;ll point you towards the airstrip which you can lap with a clear safe view of incoming wildlife all around

                                  Perhaps the best way to appreciate the majesty and immensity of Africa&rsquo;s landscapes is from the air. We can arrange for a light aircraft to fly you from Olerai up above the Rift Valley to land at a dirt airstrip beside Lake Bogoria, where we can prepare you a bush breakfast including eggs cooked in the lake&rsquo;s steam jets. In the past we&rsquo;ve also done magnificent flights all the way north to Lake Turkana and the Suguta Valley, around the peaks of Mt Kenya or the hidden valleys of the Aberdares. Speak to us about arranging any other air charters or pleasure flights that you might want

                                  Years of farming on the shores of lake Naivasha producing lucerne, cattle and cabbages, was the norm for any farmer in Kenya, but in 2001 Iain &amp; Oria decided to turn everything around and allow Nature to take over. Now with barely 12 years of growth, the tall yellow acacia forest glows golden in the evening sun as colobus monkeys with flowing white cloaks leap across the branches. Fish eagles&rsquo; nest thirty&nbsp;feet above the ground and call to each other, while below them giraffe stretch to nibble on soft leaves and zebra stallions stand guard over their harems and foals. It is an endless parade of beautiful wild things,&nbsp;and the closest experience you&rsquo;ll have to living in the Garden of Eden. At the end of the long Jacaranda Avenue interspersed with crotons and pepper trees, Lake Naivasha has risen and taken over old fields, swarms of tilapia fish swim in the shallow waters inviting storks and pelicans and all manner of water birds to make their new homes. Where the short grass grows over five hundred wild animals &ndash; buffalo, Thompson&rsquo;s gazelle, impala, waterbuck &ndash; graze in peace on the plains. Lake Naivasha is world-famous for the diversity of its birds. Every week we discover new species that have chosen to make the sanctuary their home. Having breakfast and lunch at Olerai with zebras a meter from the table is an everyday&nbsp;event, and giraffe striding elegantly by with the blue sky and great clouds above their heads is always such a delight. There is just something about them, their size, their elegance, the gliding stance, that makes you stop and stare.&nbsp;Living and walking amongst the animals is what it&rsquo;s all about &ndash; and we are thrilled to share this experience with you. The best part of the Sanctuary is &ndash; no tractors &ndash; no chemicals &ndash; no stress and strain &ndash; just an ongoing show of wildlife&nbsp;at its best!

                                  The Olerai wildlife sanctuary is a 300-acre Eden on the northern shores of Lake Naivasha, one of string of lakes between the volcanoes of the Great Rift Valley. A freshwater lake at the highest elevation of the Rift &ndash; 1,884m (6,181 ft) &ndash; Naivasha nestles in a complex geological cradle of volcanic rocks and sedimentary deposits. It is one of only two fresh-water lakes in the Kenyan Rift. The name derives from the local Maasai name <em>Nai&rsquo;posha</em>, meaning &ldquo;rough water&rdquo; because of its sudden storms. The lake is home to 400+ bird species, and many buffalo, hippo, zebra, impala, leopard and giraffe. Close to us are extinct volcanoes to summit, steam geysers rising from beneath the Earth&rsquo;s crust, flamingo-fringed lakes to explore, and National Parks where you can cycle among the animals or watch tree-climbing lions. On the southern side of the lake, a host of thriving flower and vegetable farms that supply many supermarkets in Europe are also interesting to visit.&nbsp;At the end of an adventurous day, the warmth and luxury of Olerai&rsquo;s farmhouse welcomes you home,&nbsp;no matter where you&rsquo;ve been

                                      Nearly all of the food we use at <strong>Olerai House</strong> is grown or raised on a small section of land set aside on the Sanctuary, where Oria has established two large organic gardens that are now expertly managed by a staff of five. We really encourage you to come to have a look, to smell the fresh herbs, help pick some bitter oranges to make marmalade, crunch on a carrot fresh from the ground, or meet our ducks, pigs and red hens. We grow all sorts of tasty fruits and vegetable: artichokes, courgettis, tomatoes, fennel, beetroot, cabbages, peaches and strawberries, just as an example. There are wild berries and blackberries, passion fruit, and lemon and orange trees. We use no chemicals whatsoever &ndash; just a lot of good old-fashioned homemade compost that harnesses the organic power of copious amounts of hippo dung, chicken droppings, fallen leaves and green manure. Children especially enjoy an hour or two pottering around the garden, helping to pick vegetables for supper that evening, collecting eggs, communing with the chickens or feeding our two very big and very fat black pigs. Also pop into our workshop, where our craftsmen turn fallen branches and trees into furniture, fenceposts or responsible charcoal.&nbsp;We live off the land, like our ancestors, in an eco-conscious and sustainable manner

                                      > Olerai House is an easy two-hour drive from Kenya&rsquo;s capital city, Nairobi. Take the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, passing the two main turnings for Naivasha on the left and the Delamere petrol station and Farm Shop on the right. About four kilometers past Naivasha town, towards the end of the acacia forest, turn left onto the North Lake Road (you will see a big sign for Great Rift Valley Lodge). Cross the railway tracks, and continue 11km to Green Park Golf Resort. Continue straight on the dirt road for a further 8km, passing Ajabu, Loldia, K2 and Bilashaka Flowers. Our gate is marked Olerai/Sirocco and Dominio di Doriano. We can also transfer you to Wilson Airport, which serves all of Kenya&rsquo;s domestic destinations including Samburu, and Loldia, the nearest airstrip to Olerai. <strong>By Air</strong> -- Naivasha is a mere 15-minute flight from Nairobi.&nbsp;Safarilink operates <strong>daily scheduled flights to Naivasha</strong> in the high season.&nbsp; These flights connect to both Nairobi and the Maasai Mara. Governors' Aviation operates a daily flight to Loldia House&sbquo; in the Great Rift Valley&sbquo; from Nairobi Wilson Airport on request. This flight then goes on to the <strong>Masai Mara</strong>
